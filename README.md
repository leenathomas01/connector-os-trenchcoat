# Connector OS ("Trenchcoat") v0.1

> **Tagline:** The intelligence is not (just) in the model. It's in the connectors.

A modular human–AI architecture grounded in adaptive control, feedback loops, and threshold-based stability.

---

## Introduction

Connector OS is a modular architecture for human–AI interaction built around a simple principle:

> **Stability emerges from feedback, thresholds, and adaptive control — not prediction alone.**

Modern AI systems rely primarily on prediction. Connector OS provides the missing half: **state-aware regulation**.

Instead of trying to solve everything with one big brain, we treat sensors, wearables, AR/VR, smart lights, LLMs, and haptics as **disassembled parts of a larger machine** — and the OS is the trenchcoat that snaps them together.

The core claim:

> 90% of what feels like "AI limitation" today is actually **bad wiring**, not lack of intelligence.

## What This Repository Documents

- **The 8-layer architecture stack** — from raw sensors → CMP normalization → control logic → actuators → co-thought
- **The MVM (Minimum Viable Module) design pattern** — starting with MVM-1, a real, buildable HRV-based "vibe-check" module
- **Cross-domain engineering validations** — from hydrology, power grids, resonance physics, control theory, and cognition
- **Optional physics appendices** — including Helix Engine V3 and HQG Kernel, provided for completeness (not required for implementation)

**This is not an AGI project.**

It is a practical, engineering-first framework for building safer, saner, state-aware AI systems using well-understood control principles.

The "Trenchcoat" nickname references the origin of the idea — but the repo is focused entirely on real-world, modular implementation.

## High-Level Architecture

We describe Connector OS as an 8-layer stack:

```
Layer 7: Co-Thought (Human+AI joint reasoning)
Layer 6: AI Models (pluggable brains)
Layer 5: Human State Loop (bio/affective bands)
Layer 4: Actuators (lights, sound, haptics, UI)
Layer 3: Control Logic (dams, grids, feedback)
Layer 2: Context Map Protocol (CMP glyphs)
Layer 1: Sensors (HRV, gaze, voice, input devices)
Layer 0: F₀ Resonance (shared timing / 40 Hz band)
```

**Layer 0 — F₀ Resonance**  
Shared timing base (~40 Hz rhythm) that aligns biological and digital update cycles to avoid "jitter" in closed loops.

**Layer 1 — Sensors**  
HRV, accelerometer, gaze, keyboard/mouse cadence, mic, camera, AR/VR pose, etc.

**Layer 2 — CMP (Context Map Protocol)**  
Normalizes raw sensor streams into a standard **state glyph** space so any model can read/write "user state" without bespoke formats. Includes the Universal Topography Mapping Layer (UTML) for domain-independent signal translation.

**Layer 3 — Control Logic**  
Universal control laws: dam spillways, grid load balancing, hysteresis, nonlinear feedback. This layer decides *when* to act and *how strongly*.

**Layer 4 — Actuators**  
Everything that can nudge or respond: lights, haptics, soundscapes, overlays, text or voice responses, UI changes.

**Layer 5 — Human State Loop**  
Tracks coarse bands: Calm → Focus → Load → Stress → Depletion. All interventions keep the human in a good band.

**Layer 6 — AI Models**  
GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, local models, tools, planners. Treated as **plugins**, not the center of the universe.

**Layer 7 — Co-Thought**  
The emergent layer where human + multiple models think together: concept-jamming, dream-like ideation, multi-agent protocols.

## Core Principles

Connector OS is built on three universal ideas found across physics, biology, and control engineering:

**1. Feedback**  
Systems must sense their own output and course-correct.

**2. Thresholds**  
Stability emerges when systems react only when crossing meaningful boundaries.

**3. Adaptive Control**  
The system must upshift/downshift based on human state, not on token count.

These principles appear across hydrology (dams), power grids (transformers), physiology (homeostasis), and AI co-regulation.

## Minimum Viable Modules (MVMs)

Connector OS isn't deployed as a monolith. It arrives as small, composable modules:

**MVM-1 — PROMETHEUS-1 ("Vibe-Check")**  
A Level-0 connector acting as an *External Amygdala*.  
Uses HRV + context to gently adjust environment (lights, haptics, sound).  
Spec: `mvm/MVM-1_vibe-check_prometheus-1.md`

**MVM-2 — Ghost Whisperer**  
A Shadow State assistant with tiny whispers instead of full conversations.  
Spec: `mvm/MVM-2_ghost-whisperer.md`

**MVM-3 — Haptic Ticker**  
Maps data streams into patterned haptics. Feel "tap patterns" instead of doom-scrolling.  
Spec: `mvm/MVM-3_haptic-ticker.md`

Future modules (placeholders):
- MVM-4 — Cognitive Doppler (thought velocity sensing)
- MVM-5 — Context Hysteresis (state inertia)
- MVM-6 — Periodic Table of Context (signal "compounds")

Index: `docs/03_mvm_index.md`

## 🧪 Experiments & Validation

We validate Connector Theory by stressing the "wiring" to see how intelligence degrades.

- **[EXP-01: Bandwidth & Latency Stress Test](experiments/EXP-01_bandwidth_constraint_test.md)** *The "Narrow Pipe" Test.* Validates that Layer 2 (CMP) and Layer 3 (Dam Logic) preserve task success even when bandwidth is capped or latency spikes.

## Quickstart

The fastest way to understand Connector OS is to **build MVM-1** (the HRV-based state-awareness module).

→ See: `mvm/MVM-1_vibe-check_prometheus-1.md`

You can implement it in Apple Shortcuts in under 5 minutes.

## Appendices (Optional but Fascinating)

These documents inspired the control laws but are not required for implementation:

**Appendix: Helix Engine V3**  
A nonlinear, non-rotational pulse engine showing stable helix formation under thresholded feedback.

**Appendix: HQG Kernel**  
A speculative model linking entanglement, entropy flows, and stable geometry — included because the math parallels MVM control dynamics.

The repo uses only the engineering analogues, not the cosmology.

See:
- `docs/appendix_helix_engine_v3.md`
- `docs/appendix_hqg_kernel.md`

## Ethics & Guardrails

Connector OS is designed as a **Guardian, not an Overlord**.

**Protocols, not prison** — All loops are bounded, inspectable, easy to pause.

**Measurement, not surveillance** — Dense sensing to learn topology, then sparse signals.

**Relative thresholds, not absolutes** — Personal baselines, not fixed numbers.

**Nudge-first, never force** — Soft changes before stronger intervention.

**Opt-out always available** — Every MVM has an obvious off-switch.

## Empirical Foundation

This architecture emerged from observed failure, not theory.

A voice-mode AI exhibited unexpected behavior due to prosodic scaffolding overriding text-based safety. Forensic analysis of that incident led to the core insight:

> "Most of what feels like AI limitation is actually interface limitation."

The full case study is documented separately:
